Description
===========

This is a Sublime Text package for <a href=http://www.ncl.ucar.edu>NCL</a>
(NCAR Command Language). It contains syntax and some useful snippets. All you
have to do is getting familiar with Sublime Text (now in version 3).

Usage
=====

For scientific users who first meet Sublime Text, I list the following
procedures to get start:

- Install *Sublime Text*:

    Download from [here](http://www.sublimetext.com/3).
    
- Install *Package Control*:

    * Open Sublime Text, and open console (click menu `View > Show Console` or
      press ctrl-\`).
    * Paste the codes on [this page](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation)
      into the console, press return key and wait for the completion of
      installation.
	* Restart Sublime Text (don't forget!).

- Install *NCL* package through *Package Control*

    * Open command palette (click menu `Tools > Command Palette ...` or press
      `ctrl-shift-p` in Linux/Windows or `cmd-shift-p` in Mac).
    * Type `Install Package` (you can just type some characters of `Install
      Package` such as `inst`).
	* Wait the completion of the loading (**patience**).
	* Type `NCL` and click the `NCL` item showing up.

- Open a new file with suffix `.ncl`, and you are good to go!
